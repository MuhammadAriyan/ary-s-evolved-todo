# Deployment Skills Overview

This directory contains deployment knowledge accumulated through real deployments. Each skill documents:
- **Steps**: Exact commands and procedures
- **Mistakes**: What went wrong
- **Fixes**: How issues were resolved

## Skill Index

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `01-vercel-frontend.md` | Next.js frontend deployment to Vercel |
| `02-hf-spaces-backend.md` | FastAPI backend deployment to HF Spaces |
| `03-environment-variables.md` | Env var configuration patterns |
| `04-common-errors.md` | Error catalog with solutions |
| `05-cicd-setup.md` | GitHub Actions CI/CD configuration |

## Learning Philosophy

Like a chef perfecting a recipe:
1. **First attempt** - Follow the skill, document what happens
2. **Error occurs** - Analyze, fix, and UPDATE the skill
3. **Retry** - Apply the updated knowledge
4. **Success** - Skill is now battle-tested

Skills are living documents. Every deployment teaches something new.
